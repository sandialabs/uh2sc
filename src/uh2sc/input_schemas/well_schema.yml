ideal_pipes:
  required: false
  type: boolean
  meta:
    help: |
      Must be true for the current version. Only ideal adiabatic vertical pipes are
      modeled in UH2SC.
pipe_diameters:
  check_with: is_increasinglist
  required: true
  type: list
  meta:
    help: |
      Must be a list of increasing values representing pipe diameters of concentric pipes. For now, only 1 pipe is allowed
      and the list must have a length of 4 with the two first entries equal to zero (e.g., [0,0,0.1,0.12]). In the future,
      the first number will be inner radius of the outside of a pipe. If the well has a central pipe, this value will always
      be zero. The second value reprents the inner radius of the outside of a concentric pipe. This value is also zero if a simple
      circular pipe is in the concentric pipes. The third value is the outer radius of the inside of the pipe. The fourth value is
      the outer radius of the outside of the concentric pipe. If more pipes are present, 4th value is also the inner radius of the
      outside of the 2nd concentric pipe. Eventually UH2SC will allow an arbitrary number of concentric pipes but 2 (inner circular)
      and 1 concentric pipe is typical for well operations.
pipe_lengths:
  check_with: check_pipe_lengths
  required: true
  type: list
  meta:
    help: |
      A list of pipe lengths in meters. Currently UH2SC can only accept 1 value. This value enables release of gases (
      and in the future brine) at different heights in the cavern. The length of this list must be equal to the number
      of pipes. The pipe lengths must be greater than or equal to the cavern depth and less than or equal to the cavern
      height plus depth.
pipe_roughness_ratios:
  check_with: check_pipe_roughness
  required: true
  type: list
  meta:
    help: |
      NO AFFECT IN THE CURRENT VERSION: A list of pipe surface rougness values equal to the ratio of statistically
      average length of roughness features divided by
      the diameter of the pipe for the inner and outer surfaces of a pipe. Must be 1 value for a circular pipe.
      For future versions, must be 2 values for concentric pipes following the same convention as pipe_diameters.
pipe_thermal_conductivities:
  check_with: check_pipe_conductivities
  required: true
  type: list
  meta:
    help: |
      NO AFFECT IN THE CURRENT VERSION: A list of pipe thermal conductivities with length to the number of pipes
pipe_total_minor_loss_coefficients:
  check_with: check_pipe_minor_loss_coef
  required: false
  type: list
  meta:
    help: |
      NO AFFECT IN THE CURRENT VERSION: minor loss coefficients for piping changes in diameter and turns for a well
      must be the sum total for each pipe.
valves:
  required: true
  type: dict
  meta:
    help: |
      Dictionary of valves objects that conform to valve_schema.yml
control_volume_length:
  required: true
  type: number
  min: 1
  max: 1000000
ghe_name:
  required: false # ideal flow with no lateral
                  # HT if none is present.
  type: string
  meta:
    help: |
      NO AFFECT IN THE CURRENT VERSION: You must include the same GHE name as for the cavern. This has no affect though.
      The well pipes are adiabatic and do not exchange heat with the surrounding ground.

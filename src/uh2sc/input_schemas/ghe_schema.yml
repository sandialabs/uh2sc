      The radial distance in meters to constant heat flux = Qend. UH2SC assumes that the cavern is surrounded by lots
      of other salt caverns with the exact same operations occurring. This distance should be the radius of the
      cavern plus the amount of additional radial distance needed to account for all geologic material for any
      surrounding caverns. If there are not surrounding caverns, then this value should be large enough to assure
      the zero flux condition will not have a singificant effect. The surrounding rock should have 100,000's of times
      more heat capacity than the gases involved. Making this value large will increase the number of elements needed
      to accurate model the cavern heat dynamics.

      The number of axi-symmetric control volumes spanning across modeled_radial_thickness
      that will be included in the ground heat exchanger.
      Control volume boundaries are spaced logarithmically with the smallest elements being at the
      cavern-gas interface. Depending on the application, it is advised
      that 50 to several hundred elements be used. The model performance becomes inaccurate
      for verification cases when too few elements are used. Too many elements slow down calculations though.
      If a new cavern is being run, a convergence study is advised to assure sufficient numbers of elements are
      being used.
